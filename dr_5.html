      <h2>Decision Rules</h2>
      <p>
        This prototype focuses on rule-based fraud assessment. It visualizes how the system scores one specific category—<strong>payments</strong>—based on predefined business rules. Each rule evaluation contributes to an overall category outcome: <em>poor</em>, <em>average</em>, or <em>good</em>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In this view, users can see what factors (e.g., payment issues or number of months insured) have influenced the system's judgment. Additionally, users are given the ability to override the system’s result via a "user decision" column. Furthermore, a counterfactual explanation is depicted to see what is needed to change the outcome from <em>average</em> to <em>good</em>.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3>Evaluated Prototype – User Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        While the information was technically correct, users struggled to find where to begin and how to follow the logic. The directional flow was unclear, and sentence fragments in rule outcomes made interpretation more difficult.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Improved Version – Design Iteration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The layout was restructured to flow from left to right, ending with the decision outcome clearly placed on the right-hand side.</li>
        <li>Curved flowlines and colored paths were introduced to resemble a more natural, road-like progression, making the chart more visually comfortable to follow.</li>
        <li>Visual cues now clearly mark the entry point of the flowchart, reducing initial user hesitation.</li>
        <li>Explanatory phrases were revised to use semi-complete sentences like “Decision rule outcome: Average” instead of terse phrases like “Results = Average.”</li>
      </ul>
